## But WHY?

Most task managers are ugly spreadsheets. **Watchout** is built for aesthetics and speed. It floats on your desktop, matches your gaming setup, and gives you the data you need without the clutter.

### Features
* Real-time tracking of CPU, RAM, Network (Up/Down), and Disk Usage.
* One-click shrink to a tiny floating overlay. Perfect for gaming or coding.
* View and disable apps that slow down your boot time (Registry integration).
* Deep dive into processes. See the full `.exe` path and kill resource hogs instantly.
* Switch instantly between **Neon (Cyberpunk)**, **Frost (Clean Blue)**, and **Sunset (Vaporwave)**.
* Written in Rust. No telemetry. No data collection. Your data stays on your PC.
